# AgWaterMonitoringNetwork
Collective Ag Water Monitoring Network

This is my senior design project in WSU.

Project Overview
The project being made is to help farmer document water standards to help meet microbial standards. It will be a website that allows users to log in and upload water sample data. Testing will be necessary in order for the website to run most efficiently. Important areas to be tested will be user authentication and sample data being uploaded correctly.

From May 1, 2020, 
I choose to give, and hereby assign to, Washington State University (”WSU”) the ownership of this intellectual property, with full knowledge and consideration of the ramifications of this Assignment.
